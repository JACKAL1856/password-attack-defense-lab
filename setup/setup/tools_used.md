# Tools Used

This lab uses industry-standard tools to simulate real-world offline password attack and defense scenarios.

--- 

## Offensive Tooling

- **Hashcat**  
  Offline password cracking framework used for dictionary, rule-based, mask, and hybrid attacks.

- **rockyou.txt**  
  Widely known leaked password dataset used to simulate common user password behavior.

---

## Defensive Tooling

- **mkpasswd**  
  Used to generate secure password hashes, including bcrypt with configurable cost factors.

---

## Supporting Utilities

- Linux command-line tools (cp, scp, find, cat)
- Virtualization tools for isolated lab setup

---

All tools were used strictly in a controlled lab environment for educational purposes only.
